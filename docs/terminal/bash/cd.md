# Changing folders

Since bash works in the context of a current directory, you might want to run your command in some other directory. We have cd for changing location:

## Change to home directory

```
cd ~ 
```

or

```
cd     
```

## Go back one directory

```
cd ..  
```

## Go to specific directory

```
cd /home/username/Documents  
```

## Go the the previous directory you were in

```
cd -   
```
